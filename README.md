# kaylawebsite

I built this website for my friend, Kayla. She will soon be starting her own private practice where she will provide counseling services to clients. All content was written by Kayla. The "contact" page will eventually be a link to an outside 3rd party hippa compliant service. But I wanted to include it so I could complete the Code Louisville javascript requirement for front-end web development.
