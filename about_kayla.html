          <h2>About Kayla</h2>
          <p class="intro">Welcome to Renteria Counseling Services. Choosing a therapist can often be difficult--ensuring 
            a good fit is vital to your experience in therapy.  I would love to make this process a little 
            easier for you by sharing a bit about me and my experiences. </p>
            
            <p>I am a Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor serving 
            adolescents and adults in the Louisville community. I’ve lived in the Kentuckiana region my whole life, 
            growing up in New Albany, Indiana. My passion for seeking a deeper understanding of the human mind began 
            in my undergraduate studies, where I majored in Philosophy. During these studies, I developed a love for 
            exploring the human condition and the complexity of our experiences.</p>
            
            <p>I continued my academic career in the Clinical Mental Health Counseling program at Indiana State University
             in Terre Haute, Indiana. There, I studied under a highly qualified team of mental health experts. After 
             graduating with my Masters of Science, I pursued licensure as a Licensed Mental Health Counselor in Indiana 
             and as a Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor in Kentucky.</p>

          <div class="item_5">
              <p>My professional experiences have provided me the opportunity to work in residential treatment, substance 
              abuse treatment, foster care, community mental health, and most recently, private practice. I am currently 
              specializing in the treatment of trauma for both adolescents and adults. I have been trained in evidence 
              based practices that have been shown to be highly effective for anxiety, depression, and trauma. You can
              learn more about those treatment models under the Counseling Services tab.</p>
              
              <p>My mission is to work collaboratively and compassionately with you to address the areas you want to 
              change in your life. I approach the therapy process with your strengths in mind, building upon them 
              to give you the skills needed to harness strength and growth. In my office, you’ll find a comfortable,
              non-judgemental place to explore your goals and challenges. There is great power in sharing your story
                with a trusted person. I believe in that power, and I feel honored to be a part of that with each one 
                of my clients.</p>
              
              <p>When you’re ready, give me a call. I look forward to the opportunity to work with you!</p>
